Known Bugs and Issues
=====================
* The targeted block is not highlighted
* The crosshairs don't appear over sky
* Need to implement frustum culling of chunks
* Use a fixed-size array for chunks rather than a map
* It's possible to fall through the world if the current chunk is not loaded quickly enough
* The mesh building code should take into account the whole world. Then we would have to rebuild
  all adjacent meshes when deleting a block.
* Chunk boundaries can be seen through water. (The previous correction will fix this too).
* Go back to an ordinary texture array, not a cube map array. This will make it easier to do
  things like joining adjacent faces, and animating textures. It should also save memory on
  repeated textures.
* When underwater, we can't see the inner boundary of water
* When water reaches an overhang, there is a sharp boundary
* The grass side overlay looks a bit wrong on the brightest side of the cube.
