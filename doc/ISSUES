Known Bugs and Issues
=====================
* The targeted block is not highlighted
* The crosshairs don't appear over sky
* Need to implement frustum culling of chunks
* Use a fixed-size array for chunks rather than a map
* It's possible to fall through the world if the current chunk is not loaded quickly enough
* Go back to an ordinary texture array, not a cube map array. This will make it easier to do
  things like joining adjacent faces, and animating textures. It should also save memory on
  repeated textures.
* When you destroy a block at the bottom of a lake, the water doesn't fall down
* Flicker when destroying a block on a chunk boundary - need to rebuild the mesh from the
  other chunks before the one containing the deleted block
